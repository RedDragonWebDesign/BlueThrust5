## What are Clan Scripts?

"Clan Scripts" are a website engine (CMS) for gaming communities. BlueThrust is one of the best clan scripts created during the Battle.net era of clan websites (Starcraft: Brood War, 2000-2005).

## This is a fork of BlueThrust 4

The original author was nice enough to open source the scripts, [created a GitHub](https://github.com/bluethrust/clanscripts) for them, and released them with a license that allowed modification and redistribution.

I attempted to contact him via a couple of different email addresses. I didn't get a response. The original GitHub hasn't been updated since 2014. The BlueThrust.com website has a version of the scripts that haven't been updated since 2016.

I was hired by a client in 2020 to update these scripts and add features. As a result, I became pretty familiar with them.

This repository is a fork of the BlueThrust 4 scripts, and I am going to share some of the changes I made for my client. I am naming this fork BlueThrust Clan Scripts v5.

## Themes

Would you like a different website skin? There are 29 to choose from. Head on over to the [BlueThrust5-Themes repository](https://github.com/RedDragonWebDesign/BlueThrust5-Themes). I did not create these, they are from the BlueThrust website. But I am maintaining them on GitHub so that I can keep their code up to date.
